bootstrap3-loader
=================

This simple script can be used as a loader while page loading or ajax requests. This based on  <a href="http://dotnetspeak.com/2013/05/creating-simple-please-wait-dialog-with-twitter-bootstrap">
Sergey Barskiy's loader. </a> It is based on bootstrap2. I simply re write code for bootstrap3.  I would like to thank him for 
his idea.

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>Script has two functions. for show loader <b>myApp.showPleaseWait()</b> and <br> <b>myApp.hidePleaseWait(),</b>
to close loader.</p>
